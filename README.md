JEPortfolioApp - Jonas English's Website
https://jonasenglishwebsite.azurewebsites.net/

This website was created to show off my personal works, current projects, and other similar achievements. This is the first website I've developed and hosted on Azure, and thus also serves as a platform to improve my skills in ASP.net, C#, Html, Css, and the MVC framework.
